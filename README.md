# React Component Suite

Creating a suite of reuseable components for advanced learning purposes.

## Components

Form Components
- Form
  - A form wrapper intended to store all data for a group of related input fields in one place. It handles the changing and updating of all values, errors, and
  validations for any input passed in as its child.
  - Form built based on a tutorial by Bharat Soni 'How to Handle Forms and Inputs with React'. https://javascript.plainenglish.io/a-better-way-to-handle-forms-and-input-with-react-e01500ac73c
- TextInput
  - A generic text input that either renders a textarea or text input based on its 'type' prop. Its value is handled by wrapping it in a form and providing it a valid id.
  - Input built based on tutorial by Bharat Soni 'Creating a generic text-input component with React'. https://medium.com/javascript-in-plain-english/creating-a-generic-text-input-component-with-react-886e0cf90016

I created this app using the React-Typescript template from Vite. As Vite has gained recent popularity in the React community due to better performance and overall useability, I opted to use it instead of the more common Create React App.
